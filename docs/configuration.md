# Nomad Tart Driver Configuration

For the optional restrictive client profile, see [build mode](build-mode.md).
The existing task options below remain available on ordinary clients. `url` is
required there; build clients take the pinned image exclusively from their profile.
`guest_agent = true` selects Tart RPC instead of SSH for ordinary startup/exec
commands (without TTY support). `source` and `artifacts` require the build profile.


This document explains all configuration parameters for the Tart VM Nomad driver, what they do, and how to use or access the resulting features from inside the VM when applicable.


## Driver Plugin Config (nomad agent)

- `enabled`: Enable the Tart driver plugin. Defaults to `true`.
  - Location: Nomad agent config (`plugin "nomad-driver-tart" { config { ... } }`).

Example:

```hcl
plugin "nomad-driver-tart" {
  config {
    enabled = true
  }
}

client {
  enabled = true
  options = {
    "driver.allowlist" = "tart"
  }
}
```


## Task Config (job spec `config { ... }`)

The following parameters go under the task’s driver config block `task { driver = "tart"; config { ... } }`.

- `url` (string, required): Tart image reference to clone (e.g. `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-base:latest`).
  - Used to `tart clone` the VM before start.

- `ssh_user` (string, required unless `pull_only = true`): Username the driver uses to SSH into the VM for logs/exec.

- `ssh_password` (string, required unless `pull_only = true`): Password used for SSH.
  - Tip: inject via Nomad template and var, not hard-coded.

- `pull_only` (bool, optional, default: `false`): When true, the task runs `tart pull <url>` on the client to populate the local image cache and exits — no VM is created, started, or deleted. Typically scheduled as a `sysbatch` job with a client constraint to pre-warm a fleet ahead of real workload tasks. See `examples/prewarm.nomad.hcl`.

- `show_ui` (bool, optional, default: `false`): Show Tart’s built-in UI window; when `false` runs headless (`--no-graphics`).

- `disk_size` (number, optional): Desired VM disk size in gigabytes. `0` leaves disk unchanged.
  - Applied via `tart set --disk-size` during setup.

- `auth { username, password }` (block, optional): Credentials for private image registries.
  - If set, driver runs `tart login <registry> --username <u> --password-stdin` prior to clone.

- `network { ... }` (block, optional): VM networking mode and Softnet options.
  - `mode` (string): One of `shared` (default NAT), `host`, `bridged`, or `softnet`.
  - `bridged_interface` (string): Required when `mode = "bridged"` (e.g. `en0` or `Wi‑Fi`).
  - `softnet_allow` (list(string)): CIDR allowlist for Softnet; implies Softnet if mode omitted.
  - `softnet_expose` (list(string)): Port forwards `EXTERNAL:INTERNAL` for Softnet; implies Softnet if mode omitted.
  - Conflicts are validated (e.g., host mode cannot combine with Softnet/bridged flags).

- `root_disk { ... }` (block, optional): Root disk runtime behavior.
  - `readonly` (bool, default: `false`): Mount root disk readonly (adds `ro`).
  - `caching_mode` (string): One of `automatic`, `uncached`, `cached`.
  - `sync_mode` (string): One of `fsync`, `full`, `none`.
  - Emitted as `--root-disk-opts=ro,caching=<mode>,sync=<mode>` as applicable.

- `directory { ... }` (block list, optional): Mount host directories into the VM.
  - `name` (string, optional): Logical name for the mount (helps identify inside the guest).
  - `path` (string, required): Absolute host path to share.
  - `options { readonly, tag }`:
    - `readonly` (bool): Mount read-only (adds `:ro`).
    - `tag` (string): Add a custom tag (emitted as `tag=<value>`).
  - Each block generates a `--dir=<spec>` argument to Tart.

- `command` (string, optional): Command to run inside the VM after the VM
  boots and SSH becomes reachable. Follows the same convention as Nomad's
  Docker, exec, and raw_exec drivers. Output is streamed to the task's
  stdout/stderr (visible via `nomad logs`). The VM is left running
  regardless of the command's exit status.
  - If set without `args`, the command is run with no arguments.
  - If `args` is set without `command`, a misconfiguration event is emitted
    and no command runs.

- `args` (list of string, optional): Arguments passed to `command`. Only
  meaningful when `command` is also set.

  Example — run a startup script constructed via a Nomad template:

  ```hcl
  template {
    data        = <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
setup-my-service --daemon
EOF
    destination = "local/startup.sh"
    perms       = "755"
  }

  config {
    # ... VM config ...
    command = "/bin/bash"
    # Inside macOS VMs, VirtioFS mounts appear under
    # /Volumes/My Shared Files/<name>/ — not at the host path.
    args    = ["/Volumes/My Shared Files/alloc/local/startup.sh"]

    directory {
      name = "alloc"
      path = "${NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR}"
    }
  }
  ```

For `directory.path`, the driver also resolves these Nomad task directory
variables to host paths before passing them to Tart:
- `${NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR}`
- `${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}`
- `${NOMAD_SECRETS_DIR}`


## VM Resources (CPU, Memory)

VM CPU and memory size are derived from the Nomad `resources` block:

- `cores` (int): Number of CPU cores given to the VM.
- `memory` (MB): Memory assigned to the VM.

The driver configures these via `tart set --cpu <cores> --memory <MB>` during setup.

Example:

```hcl
resources {
  cores  = 8      # CPU cores for the VM
  memory = 10240  # MB of RAM for the VM
}
```


## Secrets and Env From Nomad

- Nomad templates with `destination = "secrets/..."` and `env = true` populate a file in the allocation’s secrets dir. The driver automatically mounts the allocation’s secrets directory into the VM as read-only via `--dir=secrets:<path>:ro`.

How to use inside the VM:
- Inside macOS guests, shared directories appear under `/Volumes/My Shared Files/`.
- Your secrets file (e.g. `secrets.env`) will be at `/Volumes/My Shared Files/secrets/secrets.env`.
- Source or read the file as needed (e.g., `set -a; . /Volumes/My\ Shared\ Files/secrets/secrets.env; set +a`).


## Networking Details and Using from the VM

Modes mapped to Tart flags:
- `shared`/`nat`/`default` (default): NAT; no special flags.
- `host`: Adds `--net-host` (VM shares host’s network namespace characteristics).
- `bridged`: Adds `--net-bridged <interface>`; requires `bridged_interface`.
- `softnet`: Adds `--net-softnet` plus optional `--net-softnet-allow <cidrs>` and `--net-softnet-expose <ports>`.

Softnet port mappings:
- `softnet_expose = ["2222:22", "8080:80"]` makes the VM’s internal ports reachable from the host network at the listed external ports.
- Inside the VM: services listen on their normal internal ports; no changes needed.

## Access from Inside the VM

SSH
- Connect with the configured `ssh_user` and `ssh_password`.
- If you need the VM IP, on the host run `tart ip nomad-<ALLOC_ID>` (the driver names VMs `nomad-<allocid>`).

Shared directories (including secrets)
- The driver passes Tart `--dir` flags for each directory mount.
- Inside macOS guests, Tart exposes shared directories via VirtioFS. To discover mount points:
  - Run `mount | grep -i virtiofs` or inspect volumes in Finder to locate the share named after your `directory.name` (when provided).
  - If `name` is omitted, the host path may be used to derive the visible name; use `mount` to confirm.

Root disk options
- Applied at start via `--root-disk-opts=...`; no guest action required. Read-only root will prevent writes to the system volume.

Logs
- Output from the configured startup `command`/`args` is written to the task's stdout/stderr and is visible with `nomad logs`.

        #   bridged_interface = "en0"
        # }
        # network {

        #   softnet_expose = ["2222:22", "8080:80"]
        # }

        # Root disk behavior
        # root_disk {
        #   readonly     = true
        #   caching_mode = "automatic"  # or: uncached, cached
        #   sync_mode    = "full"       # or: fsync, none
        # }

        # Directory mounts
        # directory {
        #   name = "assets"
        #   path = "/Users/me/project/assets"
        #   options {
        #     readonly = true
        #     tag      = "assets"
        #   }
        # }
      }

      resources {
        cores  = 8
        memory = 10240
      }

      logs {
        max_files     = 3
        max_file_size = 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Notes and Limitations

- Images are cloned on first use; large images take time. Update and progress deadlines in your job’s `update { }` block accordingly.
- Virtualization.framework on macOS typically limits concurrent VMs per host; consider using constraints in your job to avoid oversubscription (see `examples/example.nomad.hcl`).
