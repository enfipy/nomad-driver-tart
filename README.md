# Nomad Driver for Tart VMs

<p align="center">

</p>

A custom task driver for HashiCorp Nomad that enables orchestration and management of [Tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) virtual machines on macOS.

## Cloud build profile

This fork preserves the upstream VM/SSH, networking, disk, registry authentication,
prewarming and interactive behavior below. An optional **operator-owned `build`
profile** restricts a Nomad client to trusted disposable build qualification.
Jobs cannot opt out of the profile. See [build mode](docs/build-mode.md) for
admission, guest-agent execution, ownership/recovery and the remaining live gates.

## Overview

This driver allows Nomad to manage the lifecycle of Tart VMs, providing a way to run macOS virtual machines as Nomad tasks. It integrates with Nomad's ecosystem, enabling users to deploy and manage Tart VMs through Nomad's job specification.

## Features

- Basic task lifecycle management (start, stop, destroy)
- Task status reporting
- Signal forwarding to tasks
- Placeholder for resource usage statistics
- Startup command execution with output streamed to task logs
- Control VM CPU and memory via Nomad's `resources` block
- Optional VM disk size configuration
 - Networking modes: host-only, bridged, or Softnet with allow/expose

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or later
- Nomad 1.6.x or later
- macOS with Tart installed

## Building

To build the driver plugin:

```bash
make build
# Cross compile for Apple Silicon
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 make build
```

This will create a `nomad-driver-tart` binary in the project root.

## Installation

1. Build the plugin as described above
2. Place the binary in a directory where Nomad can find it
3. Configure Nomad to use the plugin (see example configuration below)

## Configuration

For a complete list of all driver and task configuration options, see docs/configuration.md.

### Nomad Agent Configuration

Create or modify your Nomad agent configuration to include the Tart driver plugin:

```hcl
plugin "nomad-driver-tart" {
  config {
    enabled = true
  }
}

client {
  enabled = true

  options {
    "driver.allowlist" = "tart"
  }
}
```

### Job Specification

Here's an example job specification that uses the Tart driver:

```hcl
job "macos-sequoia-vanilla" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type        = "service"

  update {
    max_parallel = 1
    // Downloading a VM image can take a while as they are
    // tens of GBs in size. Give our jobs enough grace to
    // get setup properly.
    healthy_deadline  = "30m"
    progress_deadline = "60m"
  }

  group "vms" {
    count = 1

    task "vm" {
      driver = "tart"

      # Setup password with a secure Nomad var
      # Example:
      #   nomad var put nomad/jobs/macos-sequoia-vanilla ssh_password="your VM password"
      template {
        data        = <<EOH
SSH_PASSWORD={{ with nomadVar "nomad/jobs/macos-sequoia-vanilla" }}{{ .ssh_password }}{{ end }}
EOH
        destination = "secrets/file.env"
        env         = true
      }

      config {
        url          = "ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest"
        ssh_user     = "admin"
        ssh_password = "${SSH_PASSWORD}"
        # Whether or not to show the built-in Tart UI for the VM
        # Defaults to false
        show_ui      = true
        # Optional resource configuration for the VM
        # disk_size is the desired disk size in gigabytes
        disk_size  = 60

        # Networking (mutually exclusive modes)
        # Default is shared/NAT (no option needed)
        # network {
        #   mode = "host"         # or "bridged" | "softnet" | "shared"
        #   bridged_interface = "en0"   # required when mode = "bridged"
        #   softnet_allow  = ["192.168.0.0/24"]
        #   softnet_expose = ["2222:22", "8080:80"]
        # }
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500   # Number of virtual CPU shares (1 core = 1000)
        memory = 256  # Memory in MB assigned to the VM
      }

      logs {
        max_files     = 3
        max_file_size = 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Start the Nomad agent with the plugin:

```bash
nomad agent -dev -config=./examples/agent.hcl -plugin-dir=$(pwd)
```

2. In another terminal, run a job that uses the Tart driver:

```bash
nomad run ./examples/example.nomad.hcl
```

Additional examples:
- `examples/prewarm.nomad.hcl` — pre-pull a Tart image onto clients
- `examples/cursor-self-hosted-worker.nomad.hcl` — install and start a Cursor personal self-hosted worker inside a macOS VM

3. Check the status of the job and get the allocation ID:

```bash
nomad status
```

4. View the logs from the task:

```bash
nomad logs <ALLOCATION_ID>
```

## Development

On Apple Silicon, opt in to the pinned Tart interruption tests with
`TART_QUALIFICATION_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/tart go test -race ./driver -run TestRealTartInterruptedStaging`.
They use temporary Tart homes, sparse Linux disks and a localhost registry; they
never boot a VM or use the installed image cache.

### Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically formats, vets, and builds the driver for darwin/arm64 on every pull request and push to `main`. Releases are handled by a separate workflow that runs [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) whenever a tag starting with `v` is pushed. The release workflow can also be manually triggered to produce a snapshot from any commit.
